## 4. Data Sharing and Third Parties

### 4.1 Third-Party APIs

To provide real-time data (e.g., earthquake information, commuter line updates, space images), **Mico** integrates with third-party APIs. These services may collect and provide non-personalized data (e.g., location or time of an earthquake), but no personal user data (e.g., Discord IDs) is shared with these third-party services.

We do not sell or trade your personal data. We only share data in the following scenarios:

- When required by law

## 5. Data Retention

We retain your data for as long as you actively use **Mico**. If you stop using the bot or request your data to be removed, it will be deleted after 24 weeks.

## 6. Data Security

We take reasonable steps to protect your data, but no system is completely secure. You are responsible for ensuring the security of your Discord account, and we encourage you to use strong passwords and two-factor authentication.

## 7. Your Rights

You have the right to:

- Request access to the data we store about you
- Request the deletion or correction of your data
- Opt out of non-essential data collection (note that this may limit bot functionality)

To exercise these rights, contact us at axara@gmail.com.
